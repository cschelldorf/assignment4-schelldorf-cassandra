I, Cassandra Schelldorf, have read the point deduction list and understand that I will lose points for missing items. 

## code

```In order for this to work correctly, please make sure you create a section as follows:

'''html
<section class="jess">
  <span>
    <h3>Jess</h3>

      <span class="clear"><img src="images/Jess.jpeg" alt="Jess from New Girl" title="Jess from New Girl"></span>
      <blockquote>"I hope you like feminist rants, because that's kinda my thing."-Jess, from <em>New Girl</em></blockquote>

      <p><b>Jess</b> is a teacher from Portland, Oregon. A serial monogomist she has been with her last boyfriend, Spencer, for seven years. She moves into the loft after she catches Spencer cheating on her. The guys, Coach, Nick, and Schmidt help her get her stuff back. </p>
  </span>
</section>

The '<section>' has one class to divide the area by character.

### Background images
If you are only going to have text and a background image, your CSS should look like this:
'''css
body{
  background-image: url("../images/tv.png");
  }
'''

  If you are going to have an image inside of the '<section>', your css should look like this:
  '''css
  section.characters img{
    position: inline;
    top: 60px;
    left: 0px;
    padding: 10px;
    float: left;
    width: 45%;
  }
  '''
